        <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
        <p>
            “Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to generate new content by analyzing 
            and processing vast amounts of data from diverse sources. Generative AI tools can generate text, images, video, sound, 
            code, mathematical calculations, and more.” (Troy Heaps, 2024)

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Gather Your Information:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gather all the material you plan to cover during a class.</li>
                    <li>Example: course notes, discussions, and activities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare Your Information:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pick a digital place to write your information, such as Notepad, Word, or an AI chat platform.</li>
                    <li>List header and title information for the AI, such as the date and time of the class, the module being worked on, as well as if it is an online or in-person class. (This will help the AI with configuring the schedule so it can present this information for students.)</li>
                    <li>List any important scheduling details, such as class breaks or leaving room between topics for questions and discussions.</li>
                    <li>List the planned discussions, activities, and readings for the day. You should also designate what are discussions, activities, or readings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Get Creative and Personalize!</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feel free to modify your prompt to suit your personal needs by adding or changing what you see fit.</li>
                    <li>Example: You can create an importance scale for the topics and activities between mandatory and optional, which will allow the AI to designate tasks as homework or as a lecture topic.</li>
                    <li>You can also manually tell it to include pre-class preparations as well as tasks that are due after class.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Navigating to Your Chosen AI:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are many choices of Generative AI models, but for this tutorial, we will use ChatGPT.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to your browser and search for “ChatGPT.”</li>
                    <li>You may need to create a ChatGPT account; you can do this via the site or through Google.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Entering Your Prompt:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upon logging in, you should see a chat/text bar asking for a prompt.</li>
                    <li>In the chat bar, type but don’t hit enter: “Create me a lesson plan, break it into time blocks with the following information.” These will be the instructions the AI follows; you can alter this to suit your needs.</li>
                    <li>Below your instructions, copy and paste the information prepared earlier.</li>
                    <li>With all your information, submit it and the AI should begin to generate the lesson plan.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Getting Your Result:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Review the provided lesson plan.</li>
                    <li>Check for any errors or make adjustments.</li>
                    <li>Ask the AI to make any needed corrections based on personal needs.</li>
                    <li>You can now copy and paste the lesson plan and provide it to your students via your chosen method.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
